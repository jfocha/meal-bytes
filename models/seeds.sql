(0.5, "cilantro", "Cilantro Pistachio Pesto Shrimp Pasta", 
"Make the pesto by adding the following to the bowl of a food processor: cilantro, pistachios, jalapeño, garlic cloves, lime juice, olive oil, water and salt and pepper. Process until smooth, scraping down the sides and processing again, if necessary.
Next cook the shrimp: add olive oil to a large skillet or pan and place over medium high heat. Add in shrimp, garlic powder and salt and pepper; cook until shrimp is no longer pink. Remove from heat and set aside.
Cook the pasta until al dente, according to the directions on the package. Drain pasta, then add back to pot. Stir in the pesto and shrimp until well coated. Add pasta to bowls and garnish with goat cheese, a few 
cilantro leaves and a sprinkle of crushed pistachios. Serve immediately. Makes about 4 servings."),
(0.3,"pistachios","Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place cauliflower florets and cubed sweet potatoes on a large baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle on curry powder, turmeric, garlic powder, red cayenne pepper and season with 
salt and pepper. Use clean hands to toss everything together until it’s well coated with oil and spices. Spread out evenly. Roast for 30 minutes, flipping halfway in between. We want the sweet potatoes to be somewhat fork tender but still have a slight bite.
Once done cooking, add roasted sweet potato and cauliflower to a medium bowl. Add in the thawed peas, green onion, cranberries, cilantro and parsley.
Make the dressing: In a small bowl, add in tahini, lemon juice, warm water, curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, turmeric, salt and pepper. Mix well to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings to your liking. Add more warm water if necessary to thin out the 
dressing so it is spoonable. Fold the dressing into the rest of the ingredients until they are well coated. Serves 2-4, depending on how hungry you are. Garnish with a few extra scallions, cranberries and cilantro."

(1,"jalapeno", "Cook macaroni according to package directions for al dente; drain. Transfer to a greased 5-qt. slow cooker.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add jalapenos; cook and stir until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add to slow cooker. Stir in the cheeses, milk, soups, mayonnaise and pepper.
Cook, covered, on low for 3 hours or until cheese is melted and mixture is heated through. Melt remaining butter; stir in crackers. Sprinkle over macaroni mixture." ),
(3,"garlic cloves", "Fried garlic boasts an incredible ease-to-“wow” ratio—put slices of garlic in cold oil, crank the heat, and fish them out when they’re bronzed. But also the oil that’s left behind is a flavor-packed product all its own, just waiting to be whisked into sauces or turned into a cooking medium for the most aromatic fried rice that ever was. Dried-out cooked rice is the best option for stir-fries as the grains will get really crunchy."),
(.5, "lime", "In a large bowl combine the arugula, red onion, bell pepper, mango and radishes. Toss to combine and set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the garlic, mustard, key lime juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and cilantro. Whisk to combine and set aside.
for the key lime aioli
In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, garlic, key lime juice, lime zest, salt, pepper. Stir until well combined.
assemble the salad. Add dressing a few tablespoons at a time to the greens and toss until salad is lightly coated. -- You may not need all the dressing and if you have leftovers just cover and refrigerate for another salad." ),
(3.5,"olive oil", " Preheat oven to 400°F. Drizzle bottom and sides of pan with oil and use your fingers to coat. Line bottom with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate air bubbles; coat parchment with more oil. Generously sprinkle pan with sugar and tilt to coat in an even layer; tap out excess. Whisk cake flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl to combine and eliminate any lumps. Stir together amaretto, lemon juice, and vanilla in a small bowl.
Using an electric mixer on high speed (use whisk attachment if working with a stand mixer), beat eggs, lemon zest, and 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. sugar in a large bowl until mixture is very light, thick, pale, and falls off the whisk or beaters in a slowly dissolving ribbon, about 3 minutes if using a stand mixer and about 5 minutes if using a hand mixer. With mixer still on high speed, gradually stream in 1¼ cups oil and beat until incorporated and mixture is even thicker. Reduce mixer speed to low and add dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with amaretto mixture in 2 additions, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Fold batter several times with a large rubber spatula, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of bowl. Scrape batter into prepared pan, smooth top, and sprinkle with more sugar.
Place cake in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 350°F. Bake until top is golden brown, center is firm to the touch, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 40–50 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes.
Poke holes all over top of cake with a toothpick or skewer and drizzle with remaining 2 Tbsp. oil; let it absorb. Run a thin knife around edges of cake and remove ring from pan. Slide cake onto rack and let cool completely. For the best flavor and texture, wrap cake in plastic and let sit at room temperature at least a day before serving.");
