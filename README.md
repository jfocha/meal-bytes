# Meal Bytes

  ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20License-green)

  ## Description 
  
  Meal Bytes is a website that allows a user to input all of the ingredients that are already in their kitchen into our database. They then submit the information and a selection of recipes will pop up with only the selected ingredients. Users also have the option to include dietary restrictions (i.e. gluten free, vegitarian, etc) and add their own comments. Recipes can be saved to a user's profile for them to come back to later. They also have the option to change the ingredients on their list at any time to populate new recipes. This is a cost-efficient and creative way to utilize any and all items in your kitchen instead of going to the store.
  Our project stands out by its flexibility and efficiency. No need to leave the house. No need to spend money. No need to waste food. You get to choose the array of ingredients you want to choose from. You choose the dietary restrictions. No more items that sit in the back of your fridge or pantry until they expire and are never eaten. No more wasted time or food. The motivation behind Meal Bytes is a cost-efficient and creative way to utilize any and all items in your kitchen instead of going to the store. Whether the reason is saving money, trying a new recipe or just not wanting to leave the house, Meal Bytes is a resource for letting a person think outside their cooking comfort zone and try something new with what is already there.
